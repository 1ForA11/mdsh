## Modules

### @import

The `@import` function should run its arguments on first use, but not subsequent uses with the same module name:

~~~shell
    $ source "$TESTDIR/../mdsh.md"; set +e
    $ @import foo echo "first!"
    first!
    $ @import foo echo "first!"
    $ @import bar echo "second"
    second
~~~

While executing, the command should see a local value of `MDSH_MODULE` equal to the module name:

~~~shell
    $ load() { echo "$MDSH_MODULE"; }
    $ @import baz load
    baz
~~~

This value should *not* be exported to other processes:

~~~shell
    $ @import spam bash -c 'echo ${MDSH_MODULE-safe!}'
    safe!
~~~

### "Main" Blocks

The compilation system uses `MDSH_MODULE` to decide whether to execute `shell main` and `mdsh main` blocks, e.g. when these blocks are compiled:

```shell main
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# This file header is only included when built as a main program
```

```shell
# This line is always here
```

```shell mdsh
echo "# And so is this"
```

```shell mdsh main
echo "# This footer is only in the main program"
```

The result is different depending on whether it's done as a module or not:

~~~shell
    $ @import zebra mdsh-source "$TESTDIR/$TESTFILE"
    # This line is always here
    # And so is this

    $ mdsh-source "$TESTDIR/$TESTFILE"
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    # This file header is only included when built as a main program
    # This line is always here
    # And so is this
    # This footer is only in the main program
~~~

### Headers and Footers

#### @module

`@module` *name* creates a shebang header and edit warning, if invoked by the top-level module:

~~~shell
    $ @module foo.md
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    # ---
    # This file is automatically generated from foo.md - DO NOT EDIT
    # ---
    
    $ MDSH_MODULE=x @module blah.md
~~~

#### @comment

`@comment` *filename* incorporates the contents of the named file as shell comments, e.g.:

~~~shell
    $ echo -e "hey\n\nthere" >testfile
    $ MDSH_SOURCE=x @comment testfile
    # hey
    #
    # there
    
~~~

#### @main

`@main` *funcname* adds code to the **end** of the currently-compiling file that will execute *funcname*, if and only if the executing file is the top-level bash script (i.e., not being sourced):

~~~shell
    $ MDSH_MODULE=x @main fizz   # no-op during @import

    $ mdsh-source <<'EOF'
    > ```mdsh
    > echo "# code"
    > @main foo
    > echo "# more code"
    > ```
    > EOF
    # code
    # more code
    # --- All functions have been defined, main script starts here! ---
    if [[ $0 == "$BASH_SOURCE" ]]; then foo "$@"; fi
