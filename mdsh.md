# mdsh: a self-hosted Markdown-to-Shell Compiler

``mdsh`` is a compiler and interpreter for literate programs written in markdown and bash, that is itself written as a literate program in markdown and bash.  It expects to run in "bash strict mode":

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# This file is automatically generated from mdsh.md - DO NOT EDIT
set -euo pipefail  # Strict mode
```

And it includes a license header in the compiled distribution (see [LICENSE](license) file for the terms that apply to this source file as well as the compiled version):

```mdsh
# incorporate the LICENSE file as bash comments
source realpaths; realpath.location "$MDSH_SOURCE"; sed -e 's/^\(.\)/# \1/' "$REPLY/LICENSE"
```

**IMPORTANT**: just because a function is named `mdsh-something` and explained in this document does not make it a published API function!  If it's not documented in the README, consider it a private implementation detail

## Parsing

### Line Reader

The `mdsh-read` function is a bit like bash's `read` builtin, except it only reads lines and it reads them from a variable instead of a file.  It returns false if the variable is empty, otherwise it removes a line from the variable and returns it in the variable given as the second argument (minus the linefeed character).  If the second argument is omitted, `REPLY` is used (just like `read`.)

```shell

# read line from variable named by $1, reply in variable named by $2 (or REPLY)
mdsh-read() {
    [[ ${!1} && ${!1} =~ ^([^$'\n']*)($'\n'|$) ]] || return 1
    printf -v "${2-REPLY}" %s "${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"
    printf -v "$1"         %s "${!1#"$BASH_REMATCH"}"
}
```

### Parser

`mdsh-parse` is an "event-driven" mini-parser for markdown.  It takes a function name and a markdown string as arguments, and invokes the function with arguments representing "events".  Currently the only event is `backquote-fenced`, which has two extra arguments: the language of the code block, and its contents.

```shell
mdsh-parse() {
    local cmd=$1 lang block md=$2 ln
    while mdsh-read md ln; do
        case $ln in
        '```'*)
            lang=${ln#'```'}; block=
            while mdsh-read md ln && [[ $ln != '```' ]]; do block+=$ln$'\n'; done
            "$cmd" backquote-fenced "$lang" "$block"
            ;;
        '~~~'*)
            while mdsh-read md ln && [[ $ln != '~~~'* ]]; do :; done ;;
        esac
    done
}
```

The parser skips tilde-fenced blocks, so that any triple-backquote blocks inside such a block are ignored.

## Compiler

`mdsh-compile` compiles text from standard input, or from the file specified by `$1` (if given).  It runs in a subshell so that variable and function definitions from `mdsh` blocks can't affect the main process state.

```shell
mdsh-compile() (  # <-- force subshell to prevent escape of compile-time state
    (($#)) && [[ $1 != '-' ]] && exec <"$1"  # take a file or stdin
    REPLY=$(cat; echo -n _); mdsh-parse __COMPILE__ "${REPLY%_}"
)
```

The actual "compilation" consists simply of parsing the file contents using the `__COMPILE__` function as the event handler

### Code Block Handling

`__COMPILE__` emits bash code for backquote-fenced code blocks, by looking up hook functions, and either copying out their source code (using `mdsh-rewrite`), or invoking them directly:

```shell
__COMPILE__() {
    [[ $1 == backquote-fenced  && $2 ]] || return 0  # only fenced code
    local lang="${2//[^_[:alnum:]]/_}"; # convert language to safe variable/function name

    if fn-exists mdsh-lang-$lang; then
        mdsh-rewrite mdsh-lang-$lang "{" "} <<'\`\`\`'"; printf '%s```\n' "$3"
    elif fn-exists mdsh-compile-$lang; then
        mdsh-compile-$lang "$3"
    else
        mdsh-misc "$2" "$3"
    fi

    if fn-exists mdsh-after-$lang; then
        mdsh-rewrite mdsh-after-$lang
    fi
}
```

To do that, it needs to be able to detect what functions exist, and to extract their source code.

#### fn-exists

```shell
# fn-exists: succeed if argument is a function
fn-exists() { declare -F -- "$1"; } >/dev/null
```

#### mdsh-rewrite

```shell
# Output body of func $1, optionally replacing the opening/closing { and } with $2 and $3
mdsh-rewrite() {
    declare -f $1 | sed -e '1d; 2s/^{ $/'"${2-"{"}"'/; $s/^}$/'"${3-"\}"}"'/'
}
```

### Default Languages and Data Handling

By default, `mdsh` supports only `mdsh` and `shell` blocks, with everything else handled as data.  Blocks with no language, however are ignored:

```shell
mdsh-misc()          { mdsh-data "$@"; }    # Treat unknown languages as data
mdsh-compile-()      { :; }                 # Ignore language-less blocks
mdsh-compile-mdsh()  { eval "$1"; }         # Execute `mdsh` blocks in-line
mdsh-compile-shell() { printf '%s' "$1"; }  # Copy `shell` blocks to the output
```

Data blocks are processed by emitting code to add the block contents to an `mdsh_raw_X` variable:

```shell
mdsh-data() {
    printf "mdsh_raw_${1//[^_[:alnum:]]/_}+=(%q)\n" "$2"
}
```

## Command-Line Interface

The command line interface looks for functions named `mdsh.OPT` to process options of a matching name, and gives a usage error if such an option isn't found.  An option of `--` means "run the file that follows", while a `-` by itself is interpreted as "interpret standard input".  A non-option argument is treated as a file to interpret.

```shell
# Main program: check for arguments and run markdown script
mdsh-main() {
    (($#)) || mdsh-error "Usage: %s [ --compile | --eval ] markdownfile [args...]" "$0"
    case "$1" in
    --) mdsh-interpret "${@:2}" ;;
    -)  mdsh-interpret "$@" ;;
    -*) fn-exists "mdsh.$1" || mdsh-error "%s: unrecognized option: %s" "$0" "$1"
        "mdsh.$1" "${@:2}"
        ;;
    *)  mdsh-interpret "$@" ;;
    esac
}
```

### Interpreting Files

As described in the documentation, markdown files are run with an empty  `$0` and `$BASH_SOURCE`, but with `$MDSH_ZERO` set to the source file.  This is done by exec-ing bash with an immediate command to eval the compiled version of the source file.

```shell
# Run markdown file as main program, with $0 == $BASH_SOURCE == "" and
# MDSH_ZERO pointing to the original $0.

function mdsh-interpret() {
    printf -v cmd 'eval "$(%q --compile %q)"' "$0" "$1"
    MDSH_ZERO="$1" exec bash -c "$cmd" "" "${@:2}"
}
```

### --compile (-c)

Compile one or more files, appending the results to stdout.  `mdsh` blocks in each file will see an `$MDSH_SOURCE` that points to their filename (which may just be a `-`).

```shell
mdsh.--compile() {
    (($#)) || mdsh-error "Usage: %s --compile FILENAME..." "$0"
    for f; do MDSH_SOURCE=$f mdsh-compile "$f"; done
}

mdsh.-c() { mdsh.--compile "$@"; }
```

### --eval (-E)

Compile one file, which *cannot* be stdin.  Adds a suffix to ensure the compiled code returns, allowing use in shelldown headers of files that are source-able.

```shell
mdsh.--eval() {
    (($# == 1)) && [[ $1 != - ]] ||
        mdsh-error "Usage: %s --eval FILENAME" "$0"
    mdsh.--compile "$1"
    echo "__status=\$? eval 'return \$__status || exit \$__status' 2>/dev/null"
}

mdsh.-E() { mdsh.--eval "$@"; }
```

### Usage Errors

```shell
# mdsh-error: printf args to stderr and exit w/EX_USAGE (code 64)
mdsh-error() { printf "$1\n" "${@:2}" >&2; exit 64; }
```

### Help (-h and --help)

```shell
mdsh.--help() {
    printf "Usage: %s [ --compile | --eval ] markdownfile [args...]\n" "$0"
    echo -e '
Run and/or compile code blocks from markdownfile(s) to bash.
Use a filename of `-` to run or compile from stdin.

Options:
  -h, --help                Show this help message and exit
  -c, --compile MDFILE...   Compile MDFILE(s) to bash and output on stdout.
  -E, --eval MDFILE         Compile one file w/a shelldown-support footer line\n'
}

mdsh.-h() { mdsh.--help "$@"; }
```
