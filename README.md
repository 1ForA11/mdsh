## Multi-Lingual Literate Programming with `mdsh`

`mdsh` is a script interpreter for markdown files.  By default, it only executes `shell` code blocks as bash code, but you can define various bash functions to extend it to handle other languages...  and these functions can be defined in your script's  `mdsh` blocks.  For example:

~~~markdown
# Hello World in Python

窶義``mdsh
mdsh-lang-python() { python; }
窶義``

窶義``python
print("hello world!")
窶義``
~~~

If you have [basher](https://github.com/basherpm/basher), you can install `mdsh` by running `basher install bashup/mdsh`.  Otherwise just clone this repo and copy or link the `mdsh` file to a directory on your `PATH`.

### Usage

Running `mdsh some-document.md args...` will read and interpret triple-backquoted code blocks from `some-document.md`, according to the language listed on the block.  Blocks tagged as `mdsh` are interpreted as bash code, and executed immediately, as part of the markdown-to-shell translation process, so they can define mdsh hook functions (like `mdsh-lang-*`) to affect how other code blocks will be processed.

Blocks tagged with `shell`, on the other hand, can contain arbitrary bash code, inlcuding calls to various mdsh API functions described later in this document.

To process blocks in a language `X`, define a function named `mdsh-lang-X` in an `mdsh` block.  It will then be called whenever a code block of  type `X` is encountered, with the contents of the block on the function's standard input.  (Note: the function name is **case sensitive**, so a block tagged `C` (uppercase) will not use a processor defined for `c` (lowercase) or vice-versa.)

If no corresponding language processor is defined when a block of type `X` is encountered, the contents of the block are appended to a bash array named `mdsh_raw_X`, where `X` is the language tag on the code block (with non-identifier characters changed to `_`).

So, if you have code blocks with a language tag of  `foo`, then `$mdsh_raw_foo` or `${mdsh_raw_foo[0]}` will return the contents of the first such block, `${mdsh_raw_foo[1]}` is the second, and so on.  Normal bash array rules apply, and you are free to modify the array in any way you like: mdsh merely adds new elements to the array as blocks are encountered.

Functions named `mdsh-after-X` will be called *after* a code block of  type `X` is processed.  The function does *not* receive the block contents, and is called whether or not a corresponding  `mdsh-lang-X` function exists.

If there is no `mdsh-lang-X`, the `mdsh-after-X` function can read the most recent block's contents from `${mdsh_raw_X[-1]}`.  (This can be useful when running language interpreters that can't execute code via stdin, or when you want the code to run with the main script's stdin.)  If you don't unset the array, it will keep growing as more blocks of that language are encountered.

#### Command-line Arguments

You can pass additional arguments to `mdsh`, after the path to the markdown file.  These additional arguments are available as `$1`, `$2`, etc. within any top-level `shell` blocks in the markdown file.

#### Making Executable Markdown Files

If you want to make a markdown file directly executable, you can `chmod +x` it and give it a shebang line such as `#!/usr/bin/env mdsh`.  This will then let you run `somescript.md args..` without needing to type `mdsh` in front of it.

If you want to get rid of the `.md` extension on your script, you'll probably want to also add a line to tell Github, your editor, etc. that the file is still markdown, e.g.:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env mdsh
<!-- ex: set syntax=markdown : -->
```

This will tell Github, atom (with the `vim-modeline` package), and other editor/display tools that the file is actually Markdown.

(Alternately, you can keep the `.md` on the file for editing, but use an extensionless symlink to run it without needing to type the `.md`.)

### Extending `mdsh` or Reusing its Functions

Sourcing `mdsh` from a bash script will define all its functions, but not actually run a program.  This allows you to change how command line arguments are processed, or predefine additional language hooks, teardown hooks, etc.   (You can also just do it to make use of the included markdown processing functions.)

Note that sourcing `mdsh` will set bash to  ["unofficial strict mode"](http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode/) , i.e. `-euo pipefail`.  These bash modes should be in effect when executing any `mdsh`-defined functions, or Bad Things May Happen.  (For example, trying to write files to your root filesystem!)  It's highly recommended that you leave these modes in place.

#### Available Functions

The following functions are available for your use or alteration, both in markdown `shell` blocks and in scripts sourcing `mdsh`:

* `run-markdown` *mdfile args...* -- execute the specified markdown file with *args* as its positional arguments (`$1`,  `$2`, etc.)
* `mdsh-error` *format args...* --`printf` *format args* to stderr and terminate the process with errorlevel 2.  (A linefeed is added to the format automatically.)


* `markdown-to-shell` *command language_regexes...* -- read markdown from stdin, writing a sourceable shell script to stdout.  Triple-backquoted blocks whose tag matches any of the specified language-regexes are replaced with *command langtag* and a heredoc for the the block body. If no language-regexes are given, all blocks with a language are processed.

  So for example, `markdown-to-shell process python perl` would output a `process python <<` command for each `python` code block, and and a `process perl <<` command for each `perl` code block.  It's up to you to supply a *command* that can take a language-name argument and process data from its stdin.  (Typically, your full command using this would look something like `source <(markdown-to-shell cmd lang... <somefile.md)`, to parse `somefile.md` and execute the result.)

  **Note**: language regexes are in `sed` syntax, so languages like  `c++` don't need the `+` signs escaped. Conversely, if you want to match one or more of something, use `\+`.
