# Available modules (uncomment to use):

dk use: cram                  # run tests using the "cram" functional test tool
dk use: entr-watch            # watch files and re-run tests or other commands
dk use: shell-console         # make the "console" command enter a subshell
dk use: bash32                # enable doing tests/console/etc. in bash3.2 w/docker

# Define overrides, new commands, functions, etc. here:

compile-to() {
    bin/mdsh --out "$1" --compile "$LOCO_ROOT/mdsh.md"
    chmod +x "$1"
}

# Pre-build a copy of mdsh for tests
before test  compile-to "$BASHER_INSTALL_BIN"/mdsh

# Build the distribution version
before build dk test
on     build compile-to bin/mdsh
